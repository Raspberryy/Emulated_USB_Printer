####  pnp_strings.txt [<sub>open</sub>](pnp_strings.txt)
Extracted IEEE1284 string from http://www.openprinting.org/foomatic-db/db/source/printer/. Original files store a bunch more information about the different
printers. There might be additional IEEE1284 strings stored in the foomatic-db.  
This text file contains the PNP string along with the XML filename it was found in. As of January 2021 there ~4000 PNP strings.
New printers seem to be added regularly. [Source](http://www.openprinting.org/foomatic-db/db/source/printer/)
